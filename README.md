Arduino sketch to run a sewage pump monitoring thingy

Sorry to anyone searching around... this won't be terribly useful, since it is tied to some hand crafted hardware.

Required libraries:
 - adafruit gfx
 - adafruit seesaw
 - adafruit st7335


Note: if the file 'assets/poop.bmp' is put in the root of an SD card (as just poop.bmp), when the pump runs it will show the poop emoji.
